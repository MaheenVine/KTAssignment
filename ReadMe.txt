Hi there, this is where I'd like to tell how I am about to take on this task. The idea has already been given. So, I’ll start visualizing how I want it look so that it is user friendly and meets the client requirements. 
•	Wireframing the UI design before putting it into play is key, otherwise prototyping is going to eat up a lot of time (i.e. with tedious adjustments). I didn’t use any tool for wireframing, went with the good old pen n paper.
•	While making the website interactive, planning the workflow is going to be next. How each click is going to give a new user experience etc.
•	Before getting started with the front end I experimented with the database, essentially the API already given in the assignment.
On obtaining my personal application id i.e 17dc089b406235d98ae552702846df49 
After that it was all html(layout) , CSS (styling) and javascript(functionality).
Javascript fetch was used to get api responses, making the response fetch easy.
